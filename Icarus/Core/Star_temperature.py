    """Star_temperature(Star)
    This class allows to determine the flux of a star
    in a binary system using an atmosphere grid. It is derived
    from the Star class.

    The noticeable difference is that this class contains the tools
    to play with the temperature distribution at the surface using
    spherical harmonics. This is an empirical way of reconstructing
    lightcurves that present peculiar behaviours such at asymmetries.

        """_Calc_teff(temp=None, tirr=None)
        Calculates the log of the effective temperature on the
        various surface elements of the stellar surface grid.

        For surface elements that are not exposed to the primary's
        irradiated flux, the base temperature profile is described
        using spherical harmonics. This temperature is then modified
        by a factor that takes into account the gravity darking
        through the 'tempgrav' exponent specified when calling
        Make_surface().

        For the exposed surface elements, an irradiation temperature
        is added the base temperature as:
            (Tbase**4 + coschi/r**2*Tirr**4)**0.24
        where 'coschi' is the angle between the normal to the surface
        element and the direction to the irradiation source and 'r'
        is the distance.

        Note: For an empirical approach, i.e. modelling the stellar
        temperature profile using spherical harmonics only, one can
        set tempgrav = 0., which disables the gravity darkening, and
        also set tirr = 0., which disables the irradiation.
