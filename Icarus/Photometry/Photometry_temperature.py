        atmo_fln (str): A file containing the grid model information for each

                Col 1: band filename
        data_fln (str): A file containing the information for each data set.

        ndiv (int): The number of surface slice. Defines how coarse/fine the
            surface grid is.
        read (bool): If True, Icarus will use the pre-calculated geodesic
            primitives. This is the recommended option, unless you have the
            pygts package installed to calculate it on the spot.

        Note: For an empirical approach, i.e. modelling the stellar
        temperature profile using spherical harmonics only, one can
        set tempgrav = 0., which disables the gravity darkening, and
        also set tirr = 0., which disables the irradiation.
